# Purpose

The BSP (Board Specific Package) X-NUCLEO-CCA02M2 Board Drivers are based on the HAL drivers and provide a set of high level APIs relative to the hardware components and features in the evaluation board for a given STM32 processor

The BSP drivers allow a quick access to the boardsâ€™ services using high level APIs and without any specific configuration as the link with the HAL and the external components is done in intrinsic within the drivers.
