# Purpose

The High Performance PDM Filter Library has the function to decimate and filter out a Pulse Density Modulated (PDM) stream from a digital microphone,
in order to convert it to a Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) signal output stream.

The PCM output stream is implemented at different sampling rates with configurable resolution (16, 24 or 32 bit). Various decimation factors can be configured,
in order to adapt to various PDM clocks.

HP_PDM Filter has been designed to support High Performance Mode in MEMS Digital Microphones (where available).
