# Purpose

The **AcousticSL Sound Source Localization** software library is an optimized software implementation for Sound Source Localization.

Acoustic SL library implements an optimized software implementation for Sound Source Localization.

Acoustic SL allows the user to experience advanced Sound Source Localization algorithms whith a minimum effort. 

**AcousticSL features** :

- Advance Sound Source Localization algorithm.
- based on three different algoritms:
  - Cross Correlation
  - GCC-PHAT
  - BMPH
- 16 KHz PCM input
- Designed for optimal performance in applications using STâ€™s digital MEMS microphones (such as MP34DT06J).
- Easy portability across different STM32 MCU families thanks to modular architecture and STM32Cube
- Free user-friendly license terms

Here is the list of references to the user documents:
